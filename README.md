# 📊 Candidate Performance Prediction Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world recruitment analytics problem:  
**Can we predict a candidate’s future job performance based on pre-employment evaluation metrics?**

Using synthetic data, we build and evaluate machine learning models to classify candidates into performance categories.

This project demonstrates:

- Data simulation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Analytical interpretation of results

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations invest significant resources in recruitment. Predicting candidate performance before hiring can improve decision-making and reduce turnover costs.

This project aims to:

> Predict whether a candidate will be a **High**, **Average**, or **Low** performer based on structured evaluation data.

## 🧾 Dataset (Simulated)

Since real hiring data is confidential, this project generates synthetic candidate data with the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| education_level | Candidate’s highest level of education |
| years_experience | Number of years in relevant field |
| technical_test_score | Technical assessment score (0–100) |
| interview_score | Interview evaluation score (0–100) |
| personality_score | Behavioral/personality assessment score |
| previous_rating | Performance rating from past role |
| performance_label | Target variable (High / Average / Low) |

**Dataset size:** ~500–1000 simulated candidates.
